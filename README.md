<h1>Forest-Fire-Prediction-Using-Weather-Data-Observations</h1> 

#### Real time web app for prediction the likelihood of a forest fire based on location sensor data.

The primary objective of this project was to create a real time web application that displays weather information based on location sensor data while also providing predictive analysis to assess the likelihood of a fire incident. To predict forest fires, we curated data pertaining to rainfall, relative humidity, and temperature, considering their availability and significance in the predictive modeling process. We implemented an ensemble ML model to enhance performance by incorporating the most effective algorithms from our dataset, combined with a voting classifier.
